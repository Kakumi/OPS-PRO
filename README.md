No installation file is available at the moment, as the application is still under development and unusable without a server.

In the case of development, here's how to proceed.
* Download OPS Pro Server and open the solution.
* In `appsettings.Development.json` or `appsettings.Production.json` modify the line: `“CardsPath”: “path\to\cards.json”` to target the JSON card data file. **This file is generated via an external tool that will be made available later. In the meantime, you'll find the file on the OPS Pro Server.
* Launch OPS Pro Server (Profile: `Run Dev` or `Run Prod`)
	* Dev is used to automate certain actions without depending on other players.
* Download OPS Pro and open the solution.
* In OPS Pro `Launch Profile` edit `Executable` and enter your path to Godot, e.g.: `C:\Path\ToGodot_v4.0-stable_mono_win64\Godot_v4.0-stable_mono_win64.exe`.
* In `Dependencies` -> `Assemblies` fix to missing or invalid DLL. You should target `OPSProServer.Contracts.dll` available after building OPS Pro Server, goto `OPSProServer\bin\Debug\net7.0\OPSProServer.Contracts.dll`.
* Launch OPS Pro (Profile: `Run`)
